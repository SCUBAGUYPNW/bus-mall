Marketing

Group 1

  As a marketer, I need to know what products to feature in the Bus-Mall catalog.
There are twenty potential products and I need to determine which products a customer is most likely to want to purchase.

  As a potential customer, I need to be shown products and I need to be able to
select from those products which product I am most likely to purchase.

  As a developer, I have a list of things I need to do. The marketer needs to know
which products out of twenty products a customer is most likely to purchase. To determine this I need to show the user a list of products and allow them to choose which product they are most likely to purchase.

  To do this I need to display three images, and allow the user a way to select an
image and have that selection stored.
I need to be sure that the images presented to the user are not duplicated in the list, and not repeated the next time the user is presented with a list to choose from.

  For the marketing team I need to be able to show them how many times a product was
selected by the user, and I also need to tell them how many times each image was presented to the user.

Group 2

As a marketer I need to present to a potential customer a list of twenty products to determine which products are most likely to be purchased.

As a potential customer I want to be able to choose from a list of products which products I would like to purchase.

As a developer I need to show the marketing team which products our test customers choose out of a list of products and how many times each product was presented to the user.

As a marketer I need to know what products to feature in our catalog. Our sales team has identified twenty potential products. I cannot fit twenty products into the Bus-Mall catalog so I need to know what products out of the twenty a customer is most likely to want to purchase.

As a test customer I want to be able to show which products I am most likely to purchase. I want my choices to be recorded for me and I want the process to choose the products to be as simple as possible.

As a developer I need to fully understand the requirements of my client and the end user of the product I develop for the client.
The marketing team has a list of twenty products and they need to know which of those twenty products a customer is most likely to want to purchase.
The user will need to be presented with a list of products and be allowed to choose which product they are most likely to purchase from that list.
I need to record what their selection was, and also which products were presented to them. I also need to be sure that the list of products presented are not duplicated, or repeated the next time a list is shown.
I need to present the data collected to the client after the user has made their selections.

Group 4

The sales team has really outdone themselves this time. They drudged up from the bottom of the barrel twenty of the most god-awful products I have ever had the misfortune to try to market to a customer. Thankfully the budget for the catalog is so small I cannot fit twenty products into it. So now I get to share my misery with the developer that was desperate enough to want to work for us and set him loose on the interns to find out which products I can remove from further consideration for the catalog.

As a marketing intern I am happy to be able to take a break from coffee runs and assist the marketing VP in deciding what products will be offered in our Winter catalog. I have been told to select which products I would most likely want to purchase. Hopefully someday I will get paid enough to actually be able to afford these fine products I am about to be presented with.

As a developer who accepted the first offer presented and now need to make the most of it until another offer is presented I need to help the marketing team weed out a few of these hideous products from the catalog.
I am going to hit those poor interns with a list of three products and they will not be able to see three more products until they swallow their pride and make a selection that will be sure to haunt them for the rest of their days. Then I will make them do it 24 more times without duplicating any products on the screen or repeating those products the next time around. If any of them make it through those twenty-five presentations I will present what products they begrudgingly selected to the marketing team along with how many times each product tortured their souls. If I keep getting to do things like this I might not want to move onto another job.
